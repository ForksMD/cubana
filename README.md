# cubana

Cubana is (will be?) a labirynth game written from scratch in C with a vulkan renderer. For now, the SDL is used for an OS-layer abstraction. Currently the game is in its early development stage, like honestly, for now there is just a mouse and keyboard controlled free flying camera viewing a quad xD.

## Building
```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . -j
```
